# Momentum

Momentum is a fitness-focused platform designed to support users at any stage of their fitness journey â€” whether you're just getting started or already committed to an active lifestyle. Our goal is to provide the tools, guidance, and motivation needed to help you stay consistent and make progress at your own pace. From personalized workout plans to expert tips, Momentum is built to keep you moving forward.

The website described here is a signup page for both types of user, to register interest to the main platform.

## User Experience

<!-- UX here -->

### UX Overview

This platform is meant to attract two types of users.

**Primary User** -
users of any age and background, who share a common goal of wanting to stay on track with their fitness goals.

**Secondary User** -
any existing fitness organisation/gym owner who currently doesn't but wishes to offer fitness or goal tracking services to existing customers.

There is clear navigation for both types of User, designed to clearly guide the user towards the appropriate section.

Users can directly contact Momentum if they wish to work with us as we are always looking for new talent to join our growing family.
