# Momentum

Momentum is a fitness-focused platform designed to support users at any stage of their fitness journey — whether you're just getting started or already committed to an active lifestyle. Our goal is to provide the tools, guidance, and motivation needed to help you stay consistent and make progress at your own pace. From personalized workout plans to expert tips, Momentum is built to keep you moving forward.

The website described here is a signup page for both types of user, to register interest to the main platform.

## UX

### UX Overview

This platform is meant to attract two types of users.

**Primary User** -
users of any age and background, who share a common goal of wanting to stay on track with their fitness goals.

**Secondary User** -
any existing fitness organisation/gym owner who currently doesn't but wishes to offer fitness or goal tracking services to existing customers.

There is clear navigation for both types of User, designed to clearly guide the user towards the appropriate section.

Users can directly contact Momentum if they wish to work with us as we are always looking for new talent to join our growing family.

To follow best practice, wireframes were developed for mobile, tablet, and desktop sizes.
I've used [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) to design my site wireframes.

## Agile Development Process

### GitHub Projects

[GitHub Projects](https://www.github.com/yenmangu/ci-momentum/projects) served as an Agile tool for this project. Through it, User Stories, issues/bugs, and Milestone tasks were planned, then subsequently tracked on a regular basis using the Kanban project board.

![screenshot](documentation/agile/gh-projects.png)

### GitHub Pages

The site was deployed to GitHub Pages. The steps to deploy are as follows:

- In the [GitHub repository](https://www.github.com/yenmangu/ci-momentum), navigate to the "Settings" tab.
- In Settings, click on the "Pages" link from the menu on the left.
- From the "Build and deployment" section, click the drop-down called "Branch", and select the **main** branch, then click "Save".
- The page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed message display to indicate the successful deployment.
- Allow up to 5 minutes for the site to fully deploy.

The live link can be found on [GitHub Pages](https://yenmangu.github.io/ci-momentum).

### Local Development

This project can be cloned or forked in order to make a local copy on your own system.

#### Cloning

You can clone the repository by following these steps:

1. Go to the [GitHub repository](https://www.github.com/yenmangu/ci-momentum).
2. Locate and click on the green "Code" button at the very top, above the commits and files.
3. Select whether you prefer to clone using "HTTPS", "SSH", or "GitHub CLI", and click the "copy" button to copy the URL to your clipboard.
4. Open "Git Bash" or "Terminal".
5. Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory.
6. In your IDE Terminal, type the following command to clone the repository:
	- `git clone https://www.github.com/yenmangu/ci-momentum.git`
7. Press "Enter" to create your local clone.


#### Forking

By forking the GitHub Repository, you make a copy of the original repository on our GitHub account to view and/or make changes without affecting the original owner's repository. You can fork this repository by using the following steps:

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the [GitHub Repository](https://www.github.com/yenmangu/ci-momentum).
2. At the top of the Repository, just below the "Settings" button on the menu, locate and click the "Fork" Button.
3. Once clicked, you should now have a copy of the original repository in your own GitHub account!

### Local VS Deployment

There are no remaining major differences between the local version when compared to the deployed version online.

## Credits

⚠️ INSTRUCTIONS ⚠️

In the following sections, you need to reference where you got your content, media, and any extra help. It is common practice to use code from other repositories and tutorials (which is totally acceptable), however, it is important to be very specific about these sources to avoid potential plagiarism.

⚠️ --- END ---⚠️

### Content

⚠️ INSTRUCTIONS ⚠️

Use this space to provide attribution links for any borrowed code snippets, elements, and resources. Ideally, you should provide an actual link to every resource used, not just a generic link to the main site. If you've used multiple components from the same source (such as Bootstrap), then you only need to list it once, but if it's multiple Codepen samples, then you should list each example individually. If you've used AI for some assistance (such as ChatGPT or Perplexity), be sure to mention that as well. A few examples have been provided below to give you some ideas.

### Media

⚠️ INSTRUCTIONS ⚠️

Use this space to provide attribution links to any media files borrowed from elsewhere (images, videos, audio, etc.). If you're the owner (or a close acquaintance) of some/all media files, then make sure to specify this information. Let the assessors know that you have explicit rights to use the media files within your project. Ideally, you should provide an actual link to every media file used, not just a generic link to the main site, unless it's AI-generated artwork.

Looking for some media files? Here are some popular sites to use. The list of examples below is by no means exhaustive. Within the Code Institute Slack community, you can find more "free media" links by sending yourself (or Slackbot) the following command: `!freemedia`.
